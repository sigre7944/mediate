# Mediate

Mediate is the world's most awesome media aggregator! You have been tasked to build it for a cohort of demanding clients that want to find the best movies and music to promote their brands.  To build and test the app, we'll use [`unmock`](https://githutb.com/unmock/unmock-js).

Here are three two APIs you'll be using.

| API                                                                       | Description   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| [NY Times Movie Review](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis)                | Movie Reviews |
| [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) | Music         |
| [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/documentation)                            | Photos        |

We will be building a web app that accepts a search query and lists movies, photos and songs that correspond to the query. Each item can be clicked on, and the click will take the user through to a unique page with more information about that item.

This app will communicate via a custom API to our backend, which will aggregate requests to the above services.

Happy hacking!
